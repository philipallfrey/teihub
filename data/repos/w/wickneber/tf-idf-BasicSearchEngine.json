I implemented a search engine using python 3 that would rank webpages based on the tf-idf algorithm and would search and return the most relevant webpages based on a query. This was all under the constraint that I could not exceed the allocation of 250 MB of ram and needed to search a set of websites (The UCI ICS websites) which is about 50,000 individual pages in sub second time.","files":["CS121FINAL/venv/Lib/site-packages/nltk/corpus/reader/bnc.py"],"langs":[]}
