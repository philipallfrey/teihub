A team in Rare Books and Special Collections created a TEI XML file for each of the chapbooks using TEI P5:Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange by the TEI Consortium. Level 4 coding from Best Practices for TEI in Libraries was used to guide the encoding. Headers are minimal and without bibliographic information. The woodcuts in each chapbook were assigned a classification code from the Iconclass thesaurus to describe the subject of the image.","files":["XML files to be reviewed/PN970_R4_S3_1824 (2).xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_P83_J67_1800z.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_R4_L59_1870z.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_14.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_14.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_14 (2).xml","XML reviewed/PN970_R95_L5_1821.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_17.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_P83_J67_1800z.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_14 (2).xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_17.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_R4_H6_1847.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_D4_D4_1857_no_30_DUP.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_K4_T59_1820z.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_M37_G37_1835.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_M37_G37_1835.xml","XML files to be reviewed/oddRBSC26.rnc","XML reviewed/oddRBSC26.rnc","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_K4_L54_1920.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_R87_H5_1820_000116197.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_G7_S8_1845.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_G7_L5_1845.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_G7_L5_1845.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_K49_T6_1840.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_K5_W3_1856.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_K5_W3_1856.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_B3_N4_1849.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_S863_M5_1860z.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_S863_M5_1860z.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_M24_H5_1825.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_B769_N3_1831.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_B769_N3_1831.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_A4_B8_1848.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_G6_V3_1846_DUP.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_K5_Y6_1856.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_B7696_L5_1856.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_B7696_L5_1856.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_A4_B8_1848.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_K5_S5_1848.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_L86_C45_1815.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_C52_no_5a.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_C52_no_5a.xml","XML reviewed/PN970_K5_S5_1848.xml","XML files to be reviewed/PN970_D43_H67_1811 (2).xml","XML reviewed/PN970_O5_Ser_3_No_1_1835.xml"],"langs":[]}
