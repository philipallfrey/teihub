L'elemento centrale dell'intero progetto è il testo di Mary Shelley \"Frankestein\" che è stato analizzato con gli opportuni criteri di metadatazione e catalogazione. Il sito permette una lettura facilitata attraverso l'utilizzo di un font particolare, \"Easyreading\", che consente una comoda lettura anche ad utenti con DSA.
