Everything around us can be explained and represented my mathematics. Wherever there is math, there are patterns, which we see all around us. These patterns can be detected. We are working on an automatic pattern detection software that would map current nature to simulations we have made so far using its trained model and hence extract underline code of nature if it actually exist. Some versions rely on the development of a simulated reality, a proposed technology that would seem realistic enough to convince its inhabitants the simulation was real. The hypothesis has been a central plot device of many science fiction stories and films. Many works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted, position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race.","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2020-01-24T18:03:38Z"},"ManoelTeles/DataMiningSentimentAnalysis":{"date":1590816600922,"name":"ManoelTeles/DataMiningSentimentAnalysis","url":"https://github.com/ManoelTeles/DataMiningSentimentAnalysis","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2019-12-08T14:55:35Z"},"mioppong/NBA_MVP":{"date":1590816600897,"name":"mioppong/NBA_MVP","url":"https://github.com/mioppong/NBA_MVP","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2020-03-04T00:08:10Z"},"Megha1005/Covid-19_Twitter-Data_Analysis":{"date":1590816600831,"name":"Megha1005/Covid-19_Twitter-Data_Analysis","url":"https://github.com/Megha1005/Covid-19_Twitter-Data_Analysis","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2020-05-29T19:40:48Z"},"magutma/Spellchecker":{"date":1590816600824,"name":"magutma/Spellchecker","url":"https://github.com/magutma/Spellchecker","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2019-06-27T14:06:02Z"},"mwypchlo/Relation-Extraction":{"date":1590816600819,"name":"mwypchlo/Relation-Extraction","url":"https://github.com/mwypchlo/Relation-Extraction","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2020-05-14T21:34:58Z"},"Mr-IronMan/cixingbiaozhu":{"date":1590816600818,"name":"Mr-IronMan/cixingbiaozhu","url":"https://github.com/Mr-IronMan/cixingbiaozhu","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2020-05-25T12:23:06Z"},"MSanyat/Planificateur-intelligent":{"date":1590816600809,"name":"MSanyat/Planificateur-intelligent","url":"https://github.com/MSanyat/Planificateur-intelligent","desc":"-","langs":[],"count":1,"created":"2018-10-23T08:08:06Z"},"MetalBaba98/PPC-Pilot1":{"date":1590816600805,"name":"MetalBaba98/PPC-Pilot1","url":"https://github.com/MetalBaba98/PPC-Pilot1","desc":"Part
