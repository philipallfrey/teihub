One More Voice is a digital humanities recovery project that  identifies, documents, and critically engages with the voices of racialized creators in British imperial and colonial archives. The voices take multiple forms and appear in multiple genres. Our project seeks to introduce these rich and diverse materials to broad academic and public audiences. Recourse to the voices promises to transform our understanding of imperial and colonial history and literature while foregrounding perspectives that scholarship in majority has hitherto overlooked or silenced.","files":["xml/OBJ-archive-xml/liv_021119_ART.xml","xml/OBJ-archive-xml/liv_021120_ART.xml"],"langs":["eng"]},{"date":1673811892989,"name":"Hanslick-Online/hsl-entities","url":"https://github.com/Hanslick-Online/hsl-entities","desc":"-","files":["out/listbibl.xml","out/listperson.xml"],"langs":[]},{"date":1673811892987,"name":"revuedescolonies/revuedescolonies","url":"https://github.com/revuedescolonies/revuedescolonies","desc":"Revues des Colonies Project","files":["static/odd/tei_revue.odd"],"langs":[]}];
